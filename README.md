# hello-world
iam doing as github told me to.
after tinkering a bit for a while ,i know can say that i've learned how to use git & github quite well.
As i continue to keep learning ,i wish to connect with different individuals and institiutions and colaborate with them seemlesly by using a productive & efficient product as github.
